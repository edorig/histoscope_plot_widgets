              Histo-Scope Widget Set Version 1.1 Release Notes

NEW FEATURES/ENHANCEMENTS

1) The XY Plot widget has been enhanced.  New features include:

   * Histogram support - The XY Plot widget can draw histograms in addition
                         to line/curve plots.  Various line types, marker types,
			 fill patterns, and color drawing can be specified.  
			 Error bars and adaptive histograms can also be drawn.
			 
   * Overlaid plots - Multiple sets of data can be passed to the XY Plot widget.
		      Multiple curves or histograms are drawn overlaid - each
		      succeeding curve or histogram is displayed "on top of"
		      the preceeding one.  The intent of overlaying plots is
		      so that the user can discern the shape differences of
		      plots with similar scales.  Thus if the scales of the
		      overlaid curves or histograms vary widely, the plot will
		      not be particularly useful.
		      
   * Marker plots - an XY plot can be drawn with/without lines and 
   		    with/without markers.  Even histogram data can be drawn
		    with "line-styles" that define marker types.
		    
   * New XY dialogs - New XY dialogs are available for new features such as 
                      histogram and marker styles.  A new dialog is also
		      available for setting pre-defined colors.

3) Various bugs have been fixed in all the widgets.

4) The plot widget documentation, widgets.doc, has been updated.  Please refer
   to this documentation for further information.

KNOWN BUGS/RESTRICTIONS

1) The Marker and Line Style dialog for the XY widget can not be used under
   Motif 1.1.

2) The 3DScat Widget gives no indication that holding the control key will
   make it display continuously
   
3) On some Silicon Graphics workstations, partially obscuring a window with
   any of the widgets which do image drawing (2DHist, 3DScat, 2DScat), can
   cause the data to be drawn with incorrect offset.
